- **PostgreSQL & Prisma**: Ensures a robust relational database structure for managing detailed product information  
- **Styled Components**: Maintains consistent styling across the platform  

## Features
- **Browse and Search**: Users can explore available vintage books, magazines, and comic books  
- **Category Filtering**: Filters by price range and category using checkbox functionality  
- **Shopping Cart**: Basic cart management system  
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system  
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile and desktop use  

## Team Roles & Contributions
